# Algorithm Class GraphProject written in C

Given a directed graph G = (V,E), apply the "peeling zero in-degree" topological
sort algorithm we discussed in class to nd out one topological order, or report
that it contains a cycle. If G contains an edge (u,v), then vertex u should appear
before v in the ordering. You need to implement the algorithm, and analyze its
time requirement. Your algorithm should have both the best time complexity
and the best constant factor (assuming that jV j = o(jEj)).
